# Log Archive Tool

This project contains a script to archive logs efficiently. Follow the instructions below to run the script.

## Instructions to Run

1. Navigate to the `02-log-archive` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/jaber/code/projects/roadmap-projects/devops/02-log-archive
   ```

2. Run the script with the following command:

   Replace `<source_directory>` with the path to the directory containing the logs you want to archive, and `<destination_directory>` with the path to the directory where the archived logs should be stored.
